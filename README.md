# Foreground_Mosaic
 
The program:
1) Builds a background model (MOG or MOG2) across enough of the videoframesthat you can detect substantial motion.
2) Using the background model as an initial version of your “foreground mosaic”, the detected diver in motion is added to it to  create foreground mosaic.
